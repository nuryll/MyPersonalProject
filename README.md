# Fast-Food Maze Adventure

**A 3D Third-Person Maze Game**  
Navigate through a dynamic 3D maze as a child character in a third-person view. Your goal is to collect fast food to earn points while avoiding moving fruits and vegetables (enemies) that chase you. Each fast-food pickup slightly slows the player down and increases their size, creating a risk–reward challenge.
